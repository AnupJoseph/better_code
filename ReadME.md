### A Bit Better At Coding

I am not very good at the art of writing and structuring code properly. So to be come a little better at it, I have decided to work on my coding skills by taking up project presented [here](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges).

These are not the most efficient or clever way to solve any of those. Simply my attempt at them. I might skip some entirely, I might only implement part os them, I haven't decided anything concrete. Neither will I be sticking to a specific language. It will be some combination of C++, Rust and Go I think. 

Each folder will represent one project. I'll try my best to use proper tooling for them, but I am not downloading a new IDE for a project, the tools are going to be only as good as they are for VsCode.. Umm, enjoy?
